# AI authoring with swa.ml 2.0

Treat swa.ml as typed source that must be validated, rather than prose to approximate. Start with [the usage guide](USER_GUIDE.md), inspect a relevant [complete example](../examples/), and read the affected normative chapter. Pin parser 2.0 and the exact package revision. Use the portable repository skills [swaml-author](../skills/swaml-author/SKILL.md) and [swaml-validate](../skills/swaml-validate/SKILL.md); they are versioned with the language and may be installed in the user's agent skill directory. They do not authorize publication or external messages.

## Build a model from intent

Identify execution roots and reusable component definitions. Assign each persistent value to one component attribute, configuration to const attribute and scratch data to var. Identify every exchange before writing behavior: give its two sides owned port members with provides/requires, then an explicit connect route. Decide which inputs are queued events and which are latest attributes. Bind each input exactly once.

Write operations with explicit parameter/result types. Use return for values, expressions for calls and statements for void calls. Nested operations take explicit inputs; they do not capture enclosing locals. A package operation def is parameter-only reusable behavior. Use a usage to reuse its signature/body. No class/function/calc/interface, role suffixes, call/as syntax, profile or old transition syntax is accepted.

Put activation in one schedule. Use on start/every/receive/call or after same-owner operation. Select complete policy definitions where Default is unsuitable. Keep remote calls as whole initializer/assignment/statement forms, optionally in try. Recheck live attributes after suspension; use concurrent only when the transitive operation graph cannot write. Copy-back of out parameters occurs only on success.

Multiplicity is literal and paths are indexed explicitly. Deployment targets are platform Node occurrences. Requirements and cases express intent; they are not proof or input drivers. View definitions select existing identities, with geometry separate.

## Validate–fix loop

```sh
npm run build
node out/src/cli/main.js --json model.swaml dependency.swaml
node out/src/cli/main.js --format model.swaml
node out/src/cli/main.js --json model.swaml dependency.swaml
```

Inspect errorCount and diagnostic code/range/message/data. Resolve parser/name errors before reasoning from a recovered AST. Fix the smallest relevant declaration, keeping private scopes and explicit routes intact. A suggested edit is advice to revalidate, never permission to apply a stale edit. Validate the complete source workspace after changes, including negative lookups made ambiguous by newly loaded files. Never invent a library, untyped value, implicit port, hidden event or direct destination injection to silence diagnostics.

Run a bounded simulation only after validation. Record source bytes/hashes, root, profile, options, deployment and trace. Inspect final occurrence stores and relevant failure/timeout/discard/interrupt observations. A caught failure is still evidence of that runtime failure; no-failure-observed is a finite-run statement. Show declared timing separately from observed intervals and never label zero-cost logical steps as measured WCET.

## Common diagnostics

| Group | Repair direction |
| --- | --- |
| SW2001 | Load/import the correct package, disambiguate a name, remove shadowing |
| SW2002 | Correct explicit types, record shape, fallback/result or array bounds |
| SW2003 | Add explicit redefines only for a real compatible inherited member; break cycles |
| SW2004/2005 | Repair member direction/type/route/closure, emission provenance or exclusive input owner |
| SW2006 | Correct nested scope, return/out use, effects or whole-expression suspension |
| SW2007/2008 | Repair schedule identity/signature/after graph or ordered state ownership |
| SW2009/2010 | Resolve occurrence/Node paths, case route/correlation or view subject |
| SW2011/2012 | Recheck live state after resumption; account for inactive interrupt input |
| SW2013 | Supply complete typed policy values and safe positive durations |

Keep diagnostics/evidence honest. Consult [implementation status](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) before claiming full V/E/G/K support. Publishing a page or release is a separate user-authorized action; this project requires a design preview before publication.
