# SWAML 2.0 language specification

**Edition:** 2.0.0 · **Parser:** 2.0 · **Reference profile:** swaml-reference/2.0 · **Status:** release edition, 22 October 2026.

SWAML is the Software Architecture Modeling Language: a textual language for explicit software structure, communication and executable behavior. [ADR 0016](decisions/0016-swaml-2-0.md) accepts the clean restart. The language has one component concept and one operation concept. It does not accept 1.x source. Published books and PDFs retain their original bytes.

## 1. Normative set

The [concrete grammar](../src/language/swaml.langium) defines tokens and parse structure. These chapters define validity and meaning:

1. [Structure and types](spec/01-structure-and-types.md)
2. [Ports and communication](spec/02-communication.md)
3. [Operations, schedules and states](spec/03-behavior.md)
4. [Deployment, cases, views and conformance](spec/04-systems-and-conformance.md)
5. [Proposed KerML mapping](spec/05-kerml-mapping.md)
6. [Execution contract](spec/06-execution-contract.md)
7. [Normalized model](spec/07-normalized-model.md)
8. [Conformance obligations](spec/08-conformance-obligations.md)
9. [Formal semantics](spec/09-formal-semantics.md)

[Graphical notation](GRAPHICAL_NOTATION.md), its [catalog](GRAPHICAL_CATALOG.md) and the [mapping inventory](../spec/kerml-mapping.json) complete the contract. [Usage](USER_GUIDE.md), [quick start](QUICK_START.md), [AI authoring](AI_GUIDE.md) and [examples](../examples/) are informative. [Implementation status](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) distinguishes implemented checks from contracts and future evidence.

## 2. Precedence and scope

MUST and MUST NOT state requirements; SHOULD requires a documented reason for deviation; MAY grants permission. Grammar acceptance is insufficient when prose constraints fail. Unknown syntax and unsupported editions MUST be rejected. The host selects parser 2.0 and pins its package revision; files are headerless. Formatting never changes validity.

The language is closed. No generic UML/SysML constructs, host code, dynamic topology, generics, overloading, multiple inheritance, recursion or global mutable values are implicit. Platform Nodes model placement identities rather than hardware execution. A simulator run does not prove schedulability, absence of races, universal verification, KerML conformance or graphical editability.

## 3. Invariants

- **I1 Boundary:** every exchange between different component occurrences crosses owned typed port members and an explicit connection/forwarding route.
- **I2 Ownership:** components own private attributes, children and operations. Operations own nested operations and flow or states. Nested operations never capture enclosing locals/parameters.
- **I3 Provenance:** every provided event/attribute has an emitting operation; every required event/attribute and provided operation has exactly one input owner. Forwarded boundaries have no local handler/emitter.
- **I4 Values:** payloads, arguments, results, out values and array iterations are copied. Definition identity never merges occurrence stores. Records/enums retain nominal identity.
- **I5 Policy:** each connection occurrence has a complete effective pinned policy and independent queues. Forwarding has neither. Attributes keep latest values regardless of event/request capacity.
- **I6 Presentation:** views select existing semantic identities; drawings do not create behavior or routes. Layout stays separate; declared timing and observed evidence remain distinguishable.

Local calls, startup, periodic releases, waits, state timers and same-owner after dependencies are local lifecycle/computation. Operator and test inputs use ordinary source components, emitting operations, ports and routes; no destination injection or simulator function-release API exists.

## 4. Inventory

| Family | Ownership and meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Package, import | Flat multi-segment namespace and explicit visibility |
| datatype, enum, arrays | Finite nominal records/enums and copied fixed arrays |
| Component definition/usage | Reusable structure or distinct occurrence; usage body is anonymous specialization |
| Attribute/local/parameter | Occurrence state, lexical local, copied in or success-only out |
| Port definition/usage/member | Directed typed boundary; optional and reversed prefixes |
| Connection/forwarding | Policy-bearing opposite directions or queue-free boundary alias |
| Operation definition/declaration/usage | Reusable signature/body or owned executable, nested without captures |
| Schedule/entry | Trigger binding, dispatch arguments, deadline and concurrency |
| State/transition | Ordered nested receive/timer reactions; final completion |
| Deployment/placement | Software occurrences placed on platform Node occurrences |
| Requirement/case/view | Immutable intent, routed scenario and stable selection union |

Definitions have qualified declaration identity. Occurrences have root plus indexed child paths. Activations add unique run identity. All transformations preserve these distinctions and source provenance.
