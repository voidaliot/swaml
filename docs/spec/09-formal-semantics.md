# 9. Formal semantics

Normative schemas of [swa.ml 2.0](../LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md). These constrain implementations without claiming a mechanically proved metatheory.

## 9.1 Domains

Let D be the resolved declaration/effective-member graph, O the finite indexed occurrence tree, Γ a typed lexical environment, σ occurrence stores, ρ activation locals, Q per-connection/direction/member buffers, A activations, M state/timer generations, R correlations, L serial locks, B pending releases and t integer nanoseconds.

```text
C = (D, O, σ, Q, A, M, R, L, B, t)
D ⊢ O valid
D; Γ ⊢ e : T ! ε
D; Γ ⊢ s ⇒ Γ'
C —observation→ C'
```

Values are bounded primitive scalars, nominal enums/records and fixed copied arrays; void has no inhabitant. Effect ε retains read/write/communication/suspension flags, with pure as empty. Transitive union over an acyclic call graph computes effects. The maximum class is a presentation of these flags rather than permission to erase a write beneath suspension.

## 9.2 Typing schemas

| Construct | Premises and result |
| --- | --- |
| x / x.field / x[i] | x in Γ; nominal record field or integral array index; result declared type; dynamic index must be in extent |
| Enum.literal | No live first-segment value shadows the enum; unambiguous accessible nominal enum and literal |
| operation(args) | Resolved same-owner/nested or imported pure definition; copied typed in arguments; mutable compatible out targets; result declared type; effect is union of arguments and callee |
| p.member(args) | p is owned, member requires operation; arguments satisfy signature; effect communicates and suspends |
| try(e, f) | e:T and f:U assignable to T; lazy f; effect union; no fallback only when T is void |
| var x:T=e | Compatible value, fresh live name; Γ extends with mutable x; suspension allowed only when e is whole call/try |
| x=e | Mutable local/out/attribute, compatible type; attribute write adds write effect; same whole-expression suspension rule |
| return e | e assignable to owning operation result; expression does not suspend; success copy-back |
| if/while/until/assert | bool condition; optional loop limit uint-compatible and evaluated once |
| for | Fresh initializer scope; bool condition; mutable typed update; fresh body scope each iteration |
| for in | Collection T[n], explicit compatible element type; copied collection; fresh element/body scope |
| wait/receive | Suspended continuation; owned input with explicit payload binding for receive; no implicit failure/payload name |
| interruptible | Non-stateful operation, exclusive required input; protected and handler scopes share only outer locals |
| state guard | bool, effects pure or reads state; transitions selected in authored order |
| concurrent entry | Callee transitive effect has no write and body is not stateful |
| attribute initializer | Explicit destination type; empty state environment; pure effect |

Scalar type assignability uses widening, with checked integral value conversion in assignments/parameter initialization. Port compatibility is structural by member name with contravariant operation inputs and covariant output/result payloads. Nominal records/enums do not become structurally equivalent. Array values preserve invariant element type/extent; literals are checked elementwise.

## 9.3 Transition schemas

| Rule | Configuration change and observation |
| --- | --- |
| initialize | Expand O, create separate σ[o], initialize all before startup release |
| release | Add fresh activation to B with release time/cause/deadline; bounded admission or explicit violation |
| dispatch | Acquire L[o] for serial work; copy entry arguments under lock; concurrent work captures σ[o] snapshot |
| local step | Evaluate in ρ plus live serial σ or captured concurrent snapshot; update copied cells and emit source-provenanced observations |
| suspend | Save continuation/ρ; remove serial lock; register wait timer, receive alternatives or pending request |
| ready | Mark continuation ready; serial continuation must reacquire lock before reading current σ |
| offer | Resolve alias chain, select connection/member queue, copy payload, apply latest attribute replacement or policy overflow/delivery |
| request | Create unique pending R[r] with expiry t + requestTimeout; offer request; suspend caller |
| reply | Before expiry and while pending, set immutable succeeded/failed terminal, copy success result/out, ready caller |
| timeout | At expiry, pending becomes failed; ready failure continuation; tie beats reply |
| try success/failure | Return e value on success; on RuntimeFault evaluate fallback lazily with existing σ/Q effects retained |
| interrupt | Match active region; disarm/unwind protected continuation, cancel pending correlation as interrupted, retain activation/deadline/outer ρ and committed effects |
| state reaction | Select first enabled transition, exit/effect/update/entry, invalidate old timer generation; idle releases lock |
| complete | Finish activation and unlock; correlated reply is offered separately; successful whole completion releases after targets fresh |
| violation | Deadline, activation overflow, step/concurrent resource or clock failure stops the reference run and bypasses try |

At terminal correlation, later replies cannot change R. Inactive interrupt input is discarded observably. Receive statements preserve queued early input. A state's unhandled input leaves its entry time/timer generation intact. Set entry time at the state update, before entry actions. Select an already elapsed timer after entry completes before queued input; earliest expiry then declaration order determines competing timers. Deadline/timeout measurements include suspension and backlog; zero-cost interpreter steps do not supply physical cost evidence.

## 9.4 Projection and adequacy

A conforming reference trace records enough identity and order to reconstruct observable writes, messages, state changes, waits and terminals under its chosen assumptions. A view is a pure identity selection function over D/O; Timing additionally projects a separately identified trace. No view transition changes C. A bounded run ending at a horizon retains live/open intervals. Source hashing belongs to hosts. Kernel/target refinement must preserve these observations or explicitly report unsupported semantics; syntax acceptance alone is insufficient.
