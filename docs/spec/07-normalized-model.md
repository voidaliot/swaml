# 7. Normalized model contract

Normative information-preservation contract of [swa.ml 2.0](../LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md). It defines what any exporter/target adapter must retain; it does not claim a kernel exporter exists.

## 7.1 Identity and provenance

A declaration identity is package plus owned-name path. An occurrence identity is root plus indexed containment path; an operation occurrence additionally identifies its effective declaration. Activations/correlations/messages add unique run identities. Anonymous syntax/lowering nodes use an owner plus structural slot/generation role, not an invented user declaration. Source ranges are provenance rather than persistent identities. Every semantic node except a root has one owner; reference edges never imply containment.

Each normalized node/constraint retains source declaration URI/range and any inherited/replacement provenance. A persistent editor identity map is separate, preserving renames/moves atomically with source references and sidecars. Same-type multiplicity occurrences never share stores, queues or activation identity.

## 7.2 Families

| Family | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace/package | Edition, package revision, sources, imports, unique declaration namespaces |
| Record/enum/type use | Nominal identity, fields/literals, primitive domain, fixed array shape |
| Component definition/usage | Base, effective members, explicit replacements, anonymous usage specialization, multiplicity |
| Attribute/local/parameter | Owner/scope, explicit type, const/in/out, initializer, copied-cell lifetime |
| Operation | Signature, effective whole body, nested ownership without captures, inferred effect flags/class |
| Port/member | Definition or inline members, direction, reversal, optionality, payload/signature, idempotency |
| Connection/forwarding | Endpoint occurrence references, alias provenance, structural member checks, effective policy |
| Policy | Pinned complete values and declaration/use provenance; no shared runtime queue |
| Schedule/entry | Trigger identity, effective target, dispatch arguments/bindings, period/deadline, concurrent |
| State/transition | Initial/final, entry/exit/effects, receive bindings/guard or timer, ordered selection |
| Deployment | Software/platform roots, Node paths, family/index placements, effective specificity |
| Requirement/case/view | Immutable attributes/docs, intent links, case kind/subject/actors/include/extend, route/dependency/correlation graph, ordered selection union |

Expansion creates every literal multiplicity occurrence independently and keeps the definition reference. Inheritance produces an ordered effective set; replacement points to its inherited declaration. Late-bound local calls use that occurrence's effective operation name with the preserved signature. An operation usage retains the definition signature and either inherited or replacement body; no partial merge is inferred.

## 7.3 Routes and queues

Each port occurrence has per-member projections with effective provides/requires direction. Resolve forwarding to leaf port identities, retaining the full boundary chain without queue/storage/hop. Every resolved input projection references its unique owner and every provided attribute/event its emission sites. Outgoing operation projection is a request rather than an emission declaration.

A normalized connection records the two leaf ports, per-member directed routes and complete policy. Queue identity is connection occurrence, source/destination direction and member; requests/replies retain correlation separately. Attribute pending values use latest replacement, not event overflow rules. Extra provides remain contract members without fabricated peer requirements. Structural checks preserve each failed/matched member and nominal payload identity.

## 7.4 Executable lowering

Statements retain ordered operands, scopes, effects and success/failure continuations. Calls are expression nodes with a resolved local/port target, copied in/out/result types and effect flags. Try is a failure-catching node with a lazy fallback, never a rollback boundary. Wait/request/receive creates a suspended continuation plus unlock/readiness/relock; concurrent reads keep the captured dispatch snapshot. Loop limits evaluate once; for in owns one copied collection. Interrupt regions retain armed extent, input ownership, same-activation unwind, request cancellation and inactive/late-input observations.

A schedule entry lowers to a release mechanism and dispatch-time argument evaluation. After edges retain same-owner predecessor operation and completed activation identities, success-only release after unlock, fresh deadline/context and no implicit data forwarding/join. Stateful reactions retain source-order transitions, guards, timer generations and exit/effect/update/entry phases. State bodies do not gain separate executable identities. Final entry completes the operation once.

## 7.5 Presentation and equivalence

Views normalize to library definition plus ordered selected occurrences, retaining original include/filter clauses. General layouts preserve the same graph. Timing observations retain exact source/run/root/activation/correlation identities and open intervals; declared contracts remain independently identifiable. Geometry, collapse, routing bends and camera stay in sidecars.

Equivalence requires an identity-respecting correspondence preserving ownership, types/shapes, effective members, routes/policies, evaluation/effect order, schedule releases, suspension, failures, cancellation, states, deployment, intent links and selected occurrence order. Whitespace/ordinary comments are outside execution equivalence but remain required for authoring round trips. Exporters cannot drop unsupported semantics silently or claim that carrying metadata supplies execution/kernel evidence.
