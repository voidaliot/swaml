# 1. Structure, names and types

Normative chapter of [swa.ml 2.0](../LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md).

## 1.1 Names and documentation

Files contain packages without a version header. Package names may contain several :: segments; packages do not nest. import P; exposes P's top-level declarations and requires that package in the loaded workspace. Qualified references are unambiguous; ambiguous short imports are errors independent of load order. Names are unique in their scope. No overloads, implicit imports or escaped identifiers exist. The contextual words reversed, from, to, times and request remain legal names outside their syntactic positions. Other literal words in the grammar are reserved.

Identifiers use ASCII letter/underscore followed by word characters. Strings use double quotes and the portable escapes for quote, backslash, newline, carriage return and tab. Ordinary // and /* */ comments are lexical annotations. Each declaration owns at most one formal /** */ doc, first inside its body or immediately before the semicolon of a leaf. Documentation and comments do not execute.

## 1.2 Components and occurrences

component def declares a reusable type. component name: Type; creates a usage; a package-owned usage is an execution root. An untyped package usage may own inline topology. Child usages require definitions. Each root is checked independently for closure. Definitions may be reusable open libraries; an unused definition is not an execution root.

A usage body is an anonymous specialization with explicit whole-member replacement and added members, including typed roots. Single specializes inheritance is acyclic. An inherited member with the same name requires redefines; a nonexistent inherited target is an error. Replacement preserves category, types, operation signature and body category. Child component definitions may specialize the replaced type. Port replacement preserves directed compatibility and optionality. Attributes preserve constness and type. No partial operation-body merge, super dispatch or implicit shadowing exists.

A literal positive multiplicity [n] on a child creates n separate occurrences. Paths index every array usage with a literal in range, as in wheels[2].svc. Connector loops and port arrays do not exist. Composition is finite and acyclic. Definition identity does not identify an occurrence or a store.

## 1.3 State and lexical values

attribute declares component-owned mutable state; const attribute fixes its value per occurrence. Both are explicitly typed and may be redefined with a different compatible initializer in a usage. Initializers are pure and cannot read mutable state. Requirements own immutable typed attributes regardless of the const spelling.

var declares an activation/block local. in is the default parameter direction and is immutable; out parameters are mutable with success-only copy-back. Live names cannot shadow another live local, parameter or attribute. A nested operation sees its own parameters, its nested operations and the owning component's attributes, never enclosing parameters or locals. Local data access never traverses child components or ports.

## 1.4 Value domains

bool, byte (0–255), uint (0–9007199254740991), int (−9007199254740991 through 9007199254740991), finite real and string are primitive domains. void has no values and is only an operation result. Records and enums are nominal by qualified declaration identity. A datatype declares every field explicitly; a record construction supplies each once, with no extra fields. Enum literals use Type.literal; a live value named Type takes precedence, so a qualified enum reference avoids ambiguity.

Fixed arrays have positive safe extents, copied elements and invariant element type/extent. Array literals are checked elementwise against their destination type. Index expressions are integral; literal out-of-range indexes fail statically and dynamic bounds fail at runtime. In-place field/index assignment and reference values are absent.

Scalar widening is byte to uint to int to real. Known integral literals may initialize smaller integral domains if in range. General computed integral assignments are range-checked by the backend where permitted by the type rule; real never implicitly narrows. Integral arithmetic yields int; slash or a real operand yields real. Integer operations are exact within the safe domain and overflow fails. Division/remainder by zero and non-finite reals fail. Equality is recursive and type-compatible; ordering is numeric. Only and/or short-circuit. The grammar defines precedence.

## 1.5 Reuse and library boundaries

Package operation definitions use only parameters and nested operations. Their usages inherit the signature; an optional body replaces the whole body. Calls in an inherited component body resolve by name in the concrete occurrence's effective members, with signature preservation checked on redefinition. Call graphs are acyclic. No other component's operation or calculation is a fallback name resolution target.

The versioned source libraries are Swaml::Math, Swaml::Calls, Swaml::Qos, Swaml::Views and Swaml::Platform. They are always loaded but imported explicitly. Math provides abs, min, max, checked floor/round/trunc conversion to int, Unicode scalar length and concat. floor/round/trunc/length are explicitly identified host intrinsics in the reference library; round ties toward positive infinity. Their backend semantics and range failures remain required.
